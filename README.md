# BreastCancerClassification

A machine learning model was developed to classify breast cancer cases using the Logistic Regression algorithm. The model was implemented in Python with the Scikit-learn library, leveraging its robust tools for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation. 

The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, which contains features extracted from breast cancer tissue samples, with labels indicating whether the case is malignant or benign.
